# Spec: Files
When the search type is Symbol, implement tab cycling between symbol types.
In the dialog's status bar, display the scope as the symbol type name.

You'll have to implement the symbol search scope in SymbolService, to search for symbols in any of the scopes.

The default scope should be All Types.
