# README
[QuickJump](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChristianSchubert.QuickJump) was initially an extension made by Christian Schubert, but it hasn't been updated since 2019. It seems that he disappeared from the online world.
So I decompiled & recompiled it to support Visual Studio 2022.

I've also trying to add few niceties to it, mostly using LLMs. 

## Commands
- `QuickJump.ShowMethodSearchForm`: search symbols in the active document.
- `QuickJump.ShowFileSearchForm`: search files in the active solution.
- `QuickJump.ShowAllSearchForm`: search files and symbols.
